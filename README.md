# File-security-system-in-PC
The project File-security in personal computer deals with securing all the files in one’s personal computer with the help of his / her android mobile phone. Thus the file security is implemented as an application that has its working in both user’s android mobile and personal computer or laptop. This enables different levels of security and at most basic level ensures that the files that are stored in this application is accessed only when the android application allows access to enter the application. The application splits the pass code into two halves and stores it in the database. The first half of the pass code is entered in the android application and validated against the database. This paves the way to scan the QR code that is generated in the windows application. Once the QR code is scanned it is cross checked and validated. For a particular user his Laptop’s MAC address is stored as a string to be generated as a QR code. Then the second half of the passcode is validated and this gives the way for the user to access his valuable files.
